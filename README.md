This is a frontend project integrating external APIs and asynchronous data handling. Card images and shuffling are handled using the Deck of Cards API, allowing for randomized gameplay and external asset management.
<br>I learned how to consume a third-party REST API, handle asynchronous data fetching, and use external resources (card images and shuffled decks) within a JavaScript application. I also developed an understanding of managing application state, including tracking card values, remaining cards, current-round scores, final score, and game progression across user interactions. I gained experience building event-driven logic by responding to user input (button clicks) and updating the UI dynamically based on game outcomes. Used newly-learnt skills from Scrimba Full-stack developer course in updating the DOM dynamically to reflect changing game state, including rendering cards, scores, and win conditions in real time.
